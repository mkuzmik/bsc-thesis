abstract = "The focus of data scientists is essentially divided into three areas: collecting data, analyzing data, and inferring information from data. Each one of these tasks requires special personnel, takes time, and costs money. Yet, the next and the fastidious step is how to turn data into products. Therefore, this field grabs the attention of many research groups in academia as well as industry. In the last decades, data-driven approaches came into existence and gained more popularity because they require much less human effort. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is strongly among the fields influenced by data. The growth of data is behind the performance improvement of most NLP applications such as machine translation and automatic speech recognition. Consequently, many NLP applications are frequently moving from rule-based systems and knowledge-based methods to data-driven approaches. However, collected data that are based on undefined design criteria or on technically unsuitable forms will be useless. Also, they will be neglected if the size is not enough to perform the required analysis and to infer the accurate information. The chief purpose of this overview is to shed some lights on the vital role of data in various fields and give a better understanding of data in light of NLP. Expressly, it describes what happen to data during its life-cycle: building, processing, analyzing, and exploring phases."

abstract = "Due to its simplicity and versatility, k-means remains popular since it was proposed three decades ago. The performance of k-means has been enhanced from different perspectives over the years. Unfortunately, a good trade-off between quality and efficiency is hardly reached. In this paper, a novel k-means variant is presented. Different from most of k-means variants, the clustering procedure is driven by an explicit objective function, which is feasible for the whole l2-space. The classic egg-chicken loop in k-means has been simplified to a pure stochastic optimization procedure. The procedure of k-means becomes simpler and converges to a considerably better local optima. The effectiveness of this new variant has been studied extensively in different contexts, such as document clustering, nearest neighbor search and image clustering. Superior performance is observed across different scenarios."

abstract="Serverless architecture encompasses many things, and before jumping into creating serverless applications, it is important to understand exactly what serverless computing is, how it works, and the benefits and use cases for serverless computing. Generally, when people think of serverless computing, they tend to think of applications with back-ends that run on third-party services, also described as code running on ephemeral containers. In my experience, many businesses and people who are new to serverless computing will consider serverless applications to be simply ``in the cloud.'' While most serverless applications are hosted in the cloud, it's a misperception that these applications are entirely serverless. The applications still run on servers that are simply managed by another party. Two of the most popular examples of this are AWS Lambda and Azure functions. We will explore these later with hands-on examples and will also look into Google's Cloud functions.",
